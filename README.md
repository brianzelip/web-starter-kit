# Web starter kit

This is a [gulp](http://gulpjs.com)-based package for jump starting web pages. It implements the following build tools:
- Local web server with livereload
- Sass compiler
- CSS autoprefixer
- CSS minifier
- Markdown compiler

Other features include:
- [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) & a slightly updated [box](https://github.com/mrmrs/box)-sizing rule.
- The [Merriweather](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Merriweather) and [Merriweather Sans](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Merriweather+Sans) web font stack.


## Using web starter kit

1. Clone this repo (or download the repo as a zip file and unzip it) to your local environment and change the directory name to your new project name.
2. `cd new/project/directory`
3. `gulp`
4. Your default browser will open up to `localhost:8000`
5. Make your new project in the `src` directory. All edits made to the `src` directory will build to the `dist` directory.
